      Internet Information
    </h1>
    <h2>
      What is the Internet and how does data travel?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Internet is a large, interconnected network of globally communicating computers. 
      This is Mozilla's developer resource about <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Web_mechanics/How_does_the_Internet_work"> how the internet works.</a>
    </p>
    <h3>
      Internet Protocols
    </h3>
    <p>
      Protocols (TCP Protocol – breaks data into packets and reassembles the packets at destination, 
      IP Protocol – internet protocol aka internet address, open protocols). 
      The IP protocol or IP address is a unique numerical label that is the 
      identifier of communication. Much like if you are to send a letter to a 
      friend, you need the address to send that letter, and the IP is the 
      internets version of that. However, you don’t see the IP address of the 
      website you are visiting in the URL because of the DNS protocol 
      (Domain Name System) which essentially the internet address book. Instead 
      of typing in IP addresses to find a website, the DNS servers as the 
      internet address book, only needed you to type the name of the website, 
      much easier than remembering an IP address. HTTP is another protocol that
      stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol, its main function is to help web 
      browsers like chrome, edge, and safari load webpages. TCP protocol breaks 
      down the data being sent by “packaging” it, and when it arrives at its 
      destination places the packets back in order together, reassembling the 
      message.

    <h3>
      Physical Connection
    </h3>
    <p>
      Many people believe that the internet is functioning solely online, or in 
      the cloud, but internet traffic is carried out by vast cable networks set 
      on the bottom of the sea between continents. These cables are what connects 
      the internet between the entire world and are vital to keep that 
      communication going and if one of those cables where to fail, there would be 
      massive network slowdowns and parts of the internet would be inaccessible. 
      Fiber optic is becoming a more common choice that people are using for 
      internet. Unlike a router, fiber optic is run through the ground with fiber 
      optic cables. These cables are made up of dozens if not hundreds of optical 
      fibers – very thin strands of plastic or glass. They transit data by fast
      traveling pulses of light, these can transmit gigabits of data per second. 
    </p>
    <h3>
      Networks
    </h3>
    <p>
      Networks are made up of multiple computers and routers that are constructed 
      like a spider’s web. Networks have that architecture in order to help with 
      Network Redundancy. The point of Network redundancy is for the data to not 
      take the direct path to the source, but to rather follow alternative routes 
      and nodes so that if one part of the network goes down, there are still many 
      alternative pathways data can travel. Not only is the connection not sent 
      directly to the destination, but the packets of the data are also broken into 
      pieces or “packets” that get reassembled at the destination. This is called 
      Packet Switching and is a key part of network redundancy. Finally, Scalability 
      is much better with network redundancy, as when more computers are added to the 
      network, the vast web structure can handle requests and traffic efficiently. What 
      keeps the network together are routers. A router is a device that directs the 
      data packets within networks and determines the best route for that data to 
      travel. Essentially, routers are what determines and ensures that data can take
      a different path if one of the routes fails.

      What is Encoding?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Encoding is how information is translated from our language to a language that 
      computers understand, binary 1s and 0s. Binary is labeled as 1s and 0s, but it 
      would be more accurate to say on and off, a signal being off is a zero, and a 
      signal being on is a 1. Binary code has two bases, base 2 and base 10. Base 2 
      starts with the first binary signal as 1, followed by 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32. As 
      you may be able to deduce the numbers increase from giving them a higher power 
      each time, for one its 2^0, followed by 2^1, 2^2, 2^3 etc. Binary code together
      is called a bit, the bit being how many numbers of binary code can be supported,
      a 5-bit system would go up to 2^4 and a 6-bit system would go up to 2^5. 
      The higher the bit count, the greater the information and binary code that is 
      stored. Below is a screenshot of my binary calculator in excel.

    <h3>
      ASCII
    </h3>
    <p>
      ASCII stand for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. ASCII code 
      has printable characters from character code 32-127. These printable characters
      are found on your keyboard and are letters, numbers, and symbols. ASCII is 
      unique in that in only supports 128 characters meaning it is unusable for 
      non-English languages. ASCII also does not allow encoding of mathematical 
      symbols, emojis, and various writing scripts. ASCII also does not support the 
      encoding of mathematical symbols, emojis, and various writing scripts.

    <h3>
      HexaDecimal
    </h3>
    <p>
      Hexadecimal uses binary digits for its color encoding but uses four binary digits 
      to make one hexadecimal digit. One hexadecimal digit can have 16 different values, 
      with 2 hexadecimal digits together being a byte can then make 16 x 16 =256 different 
      levels of a color. Meaning that there are 256 x 256 x 256 = 16,777,216 possible color 
      combinations through hexadecimal. To make it simpler for web format, hexadecimal is 
      used on webpages as #RRGGBB. RR meaning how much red by using two hexadecimal digits, 
      gg for green, and bb for blue. A very light but intense blue would be #46194FF, the FF 
      meaning that the blue value is at its highest.

    <h3>
      What is Encryption?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Encryption is when data is converted from plaintext into an unreadable ciphertext by 
      using an algorithm and key to stop unauthorized access. Encryption is essential in 
      protecting data online as nefarious actors are able to intercept messages between 
      individuals some of those messages being confidential, like financial data.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Symmetric Encryption
    </h4>
    <p>
      Symmetric encryption is when you are able to use the same key to encrypt and decrypt 
      the data
    </p>
    <h4>
      Asymmetric Encryption
    </h4>
    <p>
      Asymmetric encryption is when 2 keys are used, one being private, the other being public, 
      with the public key encrypting the data, and the private key decrypting the data. Public keys 
      are one of the most significant innovations made to the internet, as public keys allow us to 
      purchase online, communicate without being spied on, use online banking, and keep our conduct 
      on the internet private.

    <h3>
      HTTPS and Security
    </h3>
    <p>
      HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol), but the secure version is called HTTPS (HyperText Transfer 
      Protocol Secure) encrypts data that is exchanged between a user’s browser and a website. This 
      is a guarantee of confidentiality and protection from cyber threats. HTTPS uses SSL (Secure Sockets 
      Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) for encrypting communication. TLS functions as a cryptographic 
      protocol made to secure communications over a computer network. Essentially, TLS is the protocol that 
      makes data being sent or received encrypted. If any of the data was to be intercepted, TLS prevents that 
      data to be read without the proper decryption key. When connecting to a server, it will provide a digital 
      certificate proving its identity, helping your browser make sure that it is a legitimate server, this process 
      is called the TLS handshake. TLS also uses MACs (Message Authentication Codes) to detect if there is any 
      tampering with the data.

    <h3>
      What are the best practices to keep yourself secure?
    </h3>
    <p>
      •	The best practices to combat cyber threats is first and foremost education. Almost every cyber attack is a 
      result of user error, so knowing about the threats can already help so much in avoiding them. Secondly, using 
      strong passwords is essential and never using the same password. If there were to be a data breach with a company 
      that has your account and password, that information is shared on the dark web and then used by people to try to 
      get into other accounts that you may have. Another part of password protection is 2FA (2 factor Authentication), 
      which requires you to enter in a code that is sent either to your email, phone number, or through an app to give 
      an extra layer of security. Lastly, it is wise to keep your software up to date as there are constantly new exploits 
      that hackers can use to get access to your computer, but by keeping it up to date, those exploits can be mitigated 
      by developers.
